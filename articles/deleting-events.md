question: "How do I delete an event?"

An organizer may opt to delete done or [cancelled] events anytime. However, all records of the event, including the list of orders and attendees, will be deleted as well. It is also important to note this process is irreversible.

It is advised to [process refunds], if need be, or [download the list of orders and attendees] before deleting an event.
