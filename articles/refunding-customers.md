question: How can I refund my customers?

For paid events, you may refund orders. All payment gateway fees and Ticketbase fees shall be refunded.


### Enabling refund functionality

For Stripe, there's no need to grant permission, as refunds are automatically set-up in the payment gateway.

For PayPal, you must first grant permission, by going to "[Payouts]" then clicking "Grant PayPal Refund Permission". Then follow all the instructions of PayPal.
