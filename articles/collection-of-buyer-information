###Types of Information
At Ticketbase, it is important to learn that there are three types of information that can be collected:
   * _Basic_ (default) - where basic information (first name, last name and email) are asked. Custom questions do not apply in this classification, though.
   * _Buyer_ - where, regardless of how many tickets are bought, any information about the buyer may be asked. Custom questions apply.
   * _Ticket_ - where each attendee, all the tickets are intended for, shall be asked for information. Custom questions apply.
   
###Choosing the Information Type
