question: "Which payment gateways does Ticketbase support?"
---

Ticketbase uses PayPal and Stripe\* as payment gateways. 

It is mandatory to set up a confirmed/verified PayPal or Stripe account to accept payments. If you don't have a [PayPal] or [Stripe] account, you have to set-up an account in their respective websites before you proceed.

It is also important to note that, if you have PayPal and Stripe accounts connected to your Ticketbase account, you can only use one payment gateway (PayPal OR Stripe) per event.


### Setting up your accounts

If you have a PayPal or Stripe account, you may be able to connect them to your Ticketbase account to accept payments.

Click on the dropdown menu beside your name on the upper right corner of the dashboard, and then click on "Payouts"

Follow the respective log-in procedures of the payment gateways to connect your accounts.


### Payment gateway charges

The charges of the payment gateways differ from country to country. We recommend you to visit [PayPal] or [Stripe] to check their fees.


\* Stripe support is only available in 18 countries (as of March 2015): Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, United States, Belgium (Beta), Finland (Beta), France (Beta), Germany (Beta), Luxembourg (Beta), Netherlands (Beta), Spain (Beta), Denmark (Beta), Norway (Beta), Sweden (Beta), Austria (Beta), Italy (Beta), Switzerland (Beta).
