question: How can I check-in the attendee on Ticketbase?
---

To check in attendees, you may either do it manually or through the Ticketbase app.

You may request your attendees to print a copy of their PDF tickets or saved on their mobile devices.

If they don't have a copy of their PDF ticket, you may also opt to verify their identity via valid IDs. 

### Manual Check-ins 
To manually check-in an attendee, go to “Check In” (under Sales & Attendees).

### Check-ins Through the Ticketbase App

The Ticketbase app is available on [Android] and [iOS] for free. The app can be used to scan the QR codes on the attendee's ticket.

To scan the attendee's ticket, log-in on the app using your Ticketbase credentials. Tap on the event, and scan the QR code ticket to check-in the attendee. You will then receive a confirmation on the app that the attendee has been checked in. The attendee list shall also be updated on your dashboard.
