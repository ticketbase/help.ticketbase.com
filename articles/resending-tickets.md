question: How do I re-send a confirmation email and ticket?

In the occasion that the customer did not receive the confirmation email and ticket, or is requesting to resend the confirmation email and ticket, you may resend through your dashboard or manually.

### Resending via the Ticketbase dashboard

* Confirm registration or payment and get the customer's correct email address. You can also get their order reference number or transaction reference number if they were able to record them.

* Go to "Orders" under "Sales & Attendees".
