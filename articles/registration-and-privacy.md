### Editing the order time limit

The default time limit is 15 minutes, but it can be extended to 30 or 60 minutes. Depending on the [order form], it is best to keep the time limit as short as possible.

   * Go to "Registration Options", change the time limit and the "Expired order alert" as desired.
