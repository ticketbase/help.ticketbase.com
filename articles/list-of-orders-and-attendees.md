question: "How can I download the order list and/or attendee list?"

The Order List details the each transaction that has occurred for your event, while the Attendee List details all the attendees.

**NOTE:** It is possible that the number of orders and attendees will not match, since a customer can purchase 1 or more tickets per order, depending on the limits set by the organizer.
