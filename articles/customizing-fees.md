question: "How can I customize the fees?"

Given our small, flat fee per ticket, organizers may choose to either [absorb the Ticketbase fees or let customers shoulder the fees].

Organizers can also opt to shoulder fees, like taxes, by making the ticket prices inclusive of taxes, or charge them separately, on top of the ticket prices.

### Managing fees

   * Click on the drop down button beside your name on the upper right corner of the screen, and choose "Manage Fees"

   * Add the percentage fee, and then click "Save"

**Note:** Additional fees can be changed anytime, but the changes will not take effect on live events.
