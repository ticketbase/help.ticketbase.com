question: How can I edit the information about my event?

To be able to edit your event information, you have to go to ["Edit Details"].

The event information answers the "what" and "why" about your event.

The following can be edited about your event's information:

   * **Event Title** - or the name of your event.

   * **Event Slug** - instead of the default event event title (example: www.ticketbase.com/events/event-title, where 'event-title' refers to 'slug'), it is possible to edit the slug (example: www.ticketbase.com/events/**event**), to make your communications consistent.

   * **Event description** - this section tells your target audience more about your event.

   * **Event Type** - the kind of event you're setting up.
   

### Understanding the event description editor

You may format your event description according to your desired format. 

The Ticketbase WYSIWIG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor ensures that when you're entering the formatted event information, you will instantly get to see how it will look like on the event page.
