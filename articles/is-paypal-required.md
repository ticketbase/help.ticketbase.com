**Question:** Am I required to have a PayPal account?

It is advisable to have a PayPal account to receive the ticket payments immediately. However, in select cases, we may send you a wire or a check for the amount of ticket sales. You may email us via [support@ticketbase.com] should you prefer the latter.
