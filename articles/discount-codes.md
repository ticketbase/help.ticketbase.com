question: "How can I provide discounts to possible attendees?"

For paid events, Ticketbase supports discount codes, which can be used by organizers to market the event.

The organizer can control the following:

   * **Codes** - the organizer will be asked to enter the codes they will be using for the event. As a security measure, Ticketbase does not generate discount codes. The organizer will be responsible for coming up with codes.
   
   * **Rate or Amount** - the organizer can set a specific amount OR a discount rate to be deducted from the ticket price.
   
   * **Number of uses** - discount codes may only be used for a certain number of times until it reaches the number set in this field.
   
   * **Duration** - the inclusive dates of code validity can also be controlled.
   
   * **Application on tickets** - the organizer can also specify which tickets certain codes may apply to.
   
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is possible to create different codes with different applications/attributes. Also, codes should be alpha-numberic. Ticketbase currently does not support spaces or symbols.
