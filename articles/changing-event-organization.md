question: "How do I change the organization handling the event?"
---

[Organization] refers to the overall entity handling the event (ie Event Organizer). Note that one event can only be attributed to one organization. 

To change the organization indicated on the event, go to ["Edit Details"].

### Changing the organization

If the [organization] has already been created, you may just choose which organization on the drop down menu.

If the organization hasn't been created yet, choose "None", and enter the name and description.
