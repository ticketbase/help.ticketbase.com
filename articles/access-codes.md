question: "How can I provide access codes to possible attendees?"
---

For paid events, Ticketbase supports access codes, which can be used by organizers to market the event, and to provide free access or tickets to selected attendees.

The organizer can control the following:

   * **Ticket name** - this is used to label the kind of access they are providing select recipients.
   
   * **Code** - the organizer will be asked to enter the access codes they will be using for the event. As a security measure, Ticketbase does not generate discount codes. The organizer will be responsible for coming up with codes.
   
   * **Number of uses** - access codes may only be used for a certain number of times until it reaches the number set in this field.
   
   * **Duration** - the inclusive dates of code validity can also be controlled.
