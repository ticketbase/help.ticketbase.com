question: How can I edit the event schedule?

The event schedule answers the "when" of your event. To be able to edit your event information, go to ["Edit Details"].

"Starts at" and "Ends at" refer to the event duration. 

The "Time Zone" of the event should also be consistent with the time zone of the [event location].
