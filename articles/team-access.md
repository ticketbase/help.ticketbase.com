### Giving permissions

Under the collaborator's details, you can grant them permission to your events under *Event Permissions*.

* **All Events** - the member given this permission will have access to all events created.

You may also restrict their access to certain features under *Actions*.

* **All Actions** - will give the member all actions required for the event management dashboard.
* **Selected Actions only** - will let you choose which actions the member can implement for the selected event.
