The event location answers the "where" of your event. To be able to edit your event information, go to ["Edit Details"].

There are two ways to enter the event location:

   * By searching for the event on the search field
   
   * By entering the address manually
   

### Entering the location by searching

It is possible to search for the location, if it is already registered. Using this method will automatically locate the venue on the Google Map.

**NOTE:** If the venue is saved without manually locating it on the map, the map on the event page will remain blank.


### Manually locating the venue on the map

It is important to remember that the location pin will always be at the center of the map.
